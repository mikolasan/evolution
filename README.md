> Whatever happens in the Lab, stays in the Lab.

In some remote location, there is a secret base where scientists provide experiments directed on understanding the evolution. There is a big tamagotchi interface that provides environment for the testing population and a way for scientists to measure their impact.

There are two shifts of scientists: day and night.

The _Day shift_ applies good mutations and tries to improve population under experiment to thrive.

The _Night shift_ challenges the population with different distress actions.

Choose your side and see who can win.
